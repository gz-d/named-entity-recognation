# named-entity-recognation
This is a named-entity-recognation (NER) project which I did when I took CSCI544 Applied Natural Language Processing in Fall 2021 at USC.
For this project, I applied deep learning techniques to train a classifier on NER tasks. Specifically, I built a bidirectional LSTM model which included one embedding layer, one lstm layer and two linear layers. For word vectorizations, I tried both starting from one-hot vectors and directly using the pretrained GloVe model.
